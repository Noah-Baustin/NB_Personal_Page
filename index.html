<h1>Noah Baustin</h1>

<p>I'm Western Massachusetts and grew up in a small city called Northampton. After studying food systems in undergrad, I ended up back in Northampton working for a small non profit that supported farms in a three county region in Mass.</p>
  
<p>Beginning in 2016, my passion project whenever I wasn't working at my day job was to record interviews in my community, which I self-published on a podcast called Mill River Crossing. Producing the podcast led to freelance opportunities with the local public radio station and newspapers.</p>
    
<p>As time went on, I realized that as much as I enjoyed the agriculture world, I wanted to take a shot at turning my passion into my profession. My dream is to become an investigative reporter working in long-form audio. At that point, I felt pretty good about my self-taught audio production skills. But I recognized that to become an effective investigator, I needed more formal training. Plus, it wasn't going to be easy to launch a journalism career in a small community with a dying newspaper. So I sent in my application to Berkeley, and now here I am!</p>
